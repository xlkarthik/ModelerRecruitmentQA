# 3D QA Comparator

**3D QA Comparator** automates visual quality assurance for 3D renders by comparing them against real-world reference images. It produces side-by-side annotated output highlighting discrepancies (materials, proportions, textures) and generates actionable improvement suggestions.

---

## Features

- **Image Comparison**: Upload or link render and reference images.
- **AI-Driven Analysis**: Uses OpenAIâ€™s vision models to detect differences.
- **Annotation Pipeline**: Python/Pillow script draws bounding boxes and labels.
- **JSON Output**: Gets structured `differences` and `suggestions` for further processing.
- **Web Interface**: Built with Next.js for quick uploads and results display.

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/3d-qa-comparator.git
   cd 3d-qa-comparator/qa-app-frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment:

   - Create `.env.local` in the root:

     ```ini
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
     STORAGE_PATH=/tmp/uploads
     ```

---

## Python Annotation Setup

1. Navigate to `annotations/`:

   ```bash
   cd annotations
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install requirements:

   ```bash
   python -m pip install pillow
   ```

4. Deactivate when done:

   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

---

## Running the App

```bash
# From project root
cd qa-app-frontend
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser, provide two image URLs (or uploads), and click **Compare**.

---

## Usage

- **Compare by URL**: Paste public image links into the form.
- **Compare by Upload (Pages Router)**: Switch to `/api/compare` endpoint if using file uploads.
